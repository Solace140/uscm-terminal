    "Knight, Bodhi || Upbringing:",
    "",
    "Born on January 21st 2154 in Canberra, Australia, Bodhi Knight grew up with two parents and two older brothers. His childhood was marked with poverty, yet despite this he was able to get through primary and secondary education. By the time he graduated however, his father and eldest brother were incarcerated, a sign of the growing unrest as a result of riots and growing food shortages. Bodhi himself had also had a few encounters with the law for crimes such as vandalism, petty theft, and threats against a public figure."
