    "Knight, Bodhi || Present:",
    "",
    "With the passing of the Service of Jail Act, and as part of an effort by the Government of Australia to show its allegiance to the Three World Empire and its allies, Bodhi was offered the opportunity of a new kind of parole through military service with the USMC after six years of time served. Through service that will continuously be monitored by military officers and government evaluation, Mr. Bodhi Knight has entered a contract to serve as a soldier and have four years of his prison sentence commuted for each year of service which is deemed adequate. He has also been allocated a RMC F903WE Automatic Assault Rifle as he has already had experience with said weaponry and this will minimize the United Statesâ€™ time needed to train him with a M41A Pulse Rifle, and their cost for equipping him."
