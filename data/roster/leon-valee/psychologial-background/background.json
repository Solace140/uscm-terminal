    "Earth Born — Vallée was born and raised in Lévis, Québec. Due to financial issues, he was given up for adoption at nine years old. Vallée grew up in Saint Catherine Orphanage and was regularly found in trouble in school and at the orphanage until he was removed once he turned eighteen. Vallée worked low-paying, hard labor jobs for a few years until he enlisted in the USCMC."
